# Typescript Tuples

> Learning how TypeScript 3.0, a typed superset of JavaScript, improves tuples type and introduces a new 'unknown' top type!

TypeScript 3.0 is out! It comes with enhancements for the type system, compiler, and language service. This release is shipping with the following:

- **Project references** let TypeScript projects depend on other TypeScript projects by allowing `tsconfig.json` files to reference other `tsconfig.json` files.
- Support for `defaultProps` in JSX.
- Tuples in rest parameters and spread expressions with optional elements.
- **New** `unknown` top type! It's the type-safe counterpart of `any`.
